This project consists in a set of scripts to perform a drought hazard quantitative assessment based on the threshold level method. This approach derive the drought characteristics directly from time series of observed or simulated hydrometeorological variables using the predefined threshold level.  When the variable is below this level, the site is in drought. Drought duration, severity and frequency can easily be calculated based on the relation between the each value of the variable and the reference level.
